# Wireless Network Configuration – Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview
This project demonstrates the configuration of a wireless network using Cisco
devices, including Access Points and wireless clients. The lab focuses on creating
SSIDs, securing wireless connections, and integrating wireless networks with VLANs
for segmentation and proper management.

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS
- Wireless Access Points (AP)
- SSID Configuration
- Wireless Security (WPA/WPA2)
- VLANs
- TCP/IP

---

## Configuration Summary
The configuration includes:

- Setting up Access Points (APs) and connecting them to switches
- Creating SSIDs for wireless networks
- Configuring wireless security (WPA/WPA2)
- Assigning wireless clients to VLANs
- Testing wireless connectivity and communication
- Verification of wireless client association and security settings

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- Wireless network fundamentals
- SSID creation and management
- WPA/WPA2 security and authentication
- VLAN integration for wireless clients
- Wireless client connectivity and troubleshooting

---

## Verification
Use the following commands and checks to verify configurations:

- `show running-config` – Review AP and switch configuration  
- `show vlan brief` – Verify VLAN assignment for wireless clients  
- `ping <destination_ip>` – Test connectivity from wireless clients  
- Wireless client status on AP GUI in Packet Tracer

---

## Files Included
- `Wireless_Lab.pkt` – Packet Tracer file  
- `config.txt` – Full configuration exported from devices  
- `README.md` – This documentation

---

## How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer  
2. Review Access Point and switch configuration  
3. Check SSID settings and wireless security  
4. Verify wireless clients are connected and assigned to correct VLANs  
5. Test connectivity between wireless clients and other network devices
